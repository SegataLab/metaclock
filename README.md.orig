# Ittiada - Inferring Time-Tree integrating Ancient DNA and Assemblies #

**Main features**

* Take assembled genomes (including metagenomically-assembled genomes) or NGS reads as input
* Use single genome or multiple genomes as reference
* Reduce noises from damaged ancient DNA by trimming highly frequent degenerated sites
* Support multiprocessing
* Maximize traceble evolutionary signal searching for all possible homologous genomic regions (more than coding sequences)
* Automatedly merging ancient genomes with modern ones

**Dependencies:**

* cmseq
* bo6_screen.py
* numpy

## Description

Evolution of bateria plays a pivotal role in understanding how human microbiome has been shaped.
Phylogenetic analysis has been recognized as the most powerful molecular approach for recontructing bacterial evolutionary histories.
With the advent of computational metagenomics, well-assembled bacterial genomes have been uncovered at an exponential rate. Therefore, an automated and efficient approach is required to build strain-level phologenies of
massive number of bacterial species. Here, we introduce GenomeAlnBuilder which is an automated tool for building multiple sequence alignment at the genome level,
particularly for accurately integrating ancient DNA in modern genome alignment which is used for downstrean
phylogentics analysis, such as molecular clock and highly-resolved strain-level phylogeny.
